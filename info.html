    <h2 id="Game_Hystory_Header">The History Of The Game</h2>
    <p id="history_Paragraph">
        The game of hide and seek has been played across different countries for generations, with its origins shrouded
        in mystery. However, a similar game called <q>apodidraskinda</q> was recorded in Greece in the <time
            datetime="2nd">2nd</time>
        century by Julius Pollux. Unlike the modern version of hide and seek, in <q>apodidraskinda</q> one player would
        hide while all other team members sought them out. This game was widely popular in numerous countries, and its
        variations were adapted to suit different cultures.

    <h2 id="Game_Tips_Header">Recommended Tips And Strategies</h2>
    <p id="Tips_Hide_Paragraph">
        <i><u><b>For hiders:</b></u></i><br><br>
        If you are a hider, try to think in advance about the places, you could potentially
        hide. In
        my experience, I would usually hide in the places where it is hard for others to believe that somebody can fit
        in that place. For example, inside sofa or small box or some place that has a lot of clothes where it is hard to
        notice you.
    </p>
    <p id="Tips_Seek_Paragraph">
        <i><u><b>For Seeker:</b></u></i><br><br>
        If you are a seeker, I would recommend to seek very quitely because as you go, others
        can make some
        noise without relizing you are somewhere close. This is the way how you can catch them quickly
