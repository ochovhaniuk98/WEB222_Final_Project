    <h2>Olha Chovhaniuk</h2>
    <p>I am a student of Seneca College who created this website as a final project for WEB222 course. It was my
        favourite
        game to play when I was a kid. That's why I decided to write about <q>Hide and Seek</q> game.<br><br>I declare
        that
        my assessment is wholly my own work in accordance with Seneca Academic Policy. No part of this assessment has
        been copied manually or electronically from any other source (including web sites) except for the information
        supplied by the WEB222 instructors and / or made available in this assessment for my use. I also declare that no
        part of this assignment has been distributed to other students.</p>
